# Coin Flip

A simple Coin Flip game built on [Gamba](https://github.com/gamba-labs/gamba).

This repository can be used as a starting template for a completely new Gamba game, or you can simply fork without making any changes to the code and host it for free. Every time someone plays on your site you will automatically collect fees.

## Setup

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/gamba-labs/flip/fork).

2. [Connect your forked repo and deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).

3. Set up your Environment variables using the guide shown on your deployed site.

4. Navigate to the `public` folder in your forked repo and upload a custom `logo.png` (Recommended resolution 512x512)

The last step will trigger a redeploy on Vercel, which will take a minute or so to complete. If you want to skip the last step you have to manually redeploy on Vercel for the Environment variables to take effect.

## Updating

Every time a change has been made in the main repository you will get the option to sync your fork by clicking "Sync fork" ➜ "Update branch" on Github. This will automatically trigger a redeploy on Vercel which will update your site.

## Quick deploy

Click the Deploy button to copy this repo and host it on Vercel. This is probably the fastest way to get going, but syncing your code with the main repo may be more difficult than the fork method described in the Setup section.
